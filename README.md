# Roundup article generator

This is a quick script I wrote to create my own version of Tom Woodward's [weekly web harvest](https://bionicteaching.com/category/weekly/), highly inspired by his work.

You will need:
* A Pinboard account
* To tag the interesting things you read that you want to show up in this program's output with a specific tag — I chose `roundup`, but this is configurable.

How to use:
* Install this repository after getting the files on your computer by your mechanism of choice
* Create a `tokens.js` file by copying the `tokens.example.js` file and adding your [Pinboard API token](https://pinboard.in/settings/password)
    * **NOTE**: this is not your normal Pinboard username and password, you need to use the username:password pair from [the linked page](https://pinboard.in/settings/password).
* Run this file and pipe the output somewhere
* Publish it

Happy hacking!
